===================================
🎲 HEZZ2 (CARTA-MAROC) GAME RULES 🎲
===================================

OBJECTIVE:
----------
The goal is to be the first player to run out of cards. The game ends immediately when a player plays their last card.

-----------------------------------
CORE RULES:
-----------------------------------
1. Setup:
   - A standard 40-card Spanish deck is used (Suits: Oros 🟡, Copas 🎗️, Espadas ⚔️, Bastos 🌵).
   - Each player is dealt 4 cards.
   - One card is placed face-up in the center to start the discard pile.

2. Turn Overview:
   - On your turn, you must play a card that matches the Rank (Number) OR the Suit (Color) of the top card on the discard pile.
   - Example: If the top card is "5 of Oros", you can play any "5" or any "Oros".
   - If you cannot play (or choose not to), you must DRAW one card from the deck.
   - If the drawn card is playable, you can play it immediately.

-----------------------------------
SPECIAL CARDS:
-----------------------------------

1️⃣  CARD '1' (The Skip) - "L'As"
   - Requirement: Must match the current Suit or Rank (1) to be played.
   - Effect: Skips the NEXT player's turn.
   - Strategy: Use this to prevent the next player from winning if they have few cards left.
   - Example: Player A plays '1'. Player B is skipped. Player C plays next.

2️⃣  CARD '2' (The Penalty) - "Jwaj"
   - Requirement: Must match the current Suit or Rank (2) to be played.
   - Effect: Forces the NEXT player to DRAW 2 cards and end their turn.
   - STACKING RULE: If the next player also has a '2', they can play it instead of drawing. 
     The penalty then stacks to 4 cards for the player after them! (2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 2 = 6, etc.)
   - Strategy: Save these for defense or to attack the player next to you.

7️⃣  CARD '7' (The Wild) - "Sba3"
   - Requirement: Must match the current Suit or Rank (7) to be played.
   - Bonus: The player who plays a '7' gets to choose the new active Suit (Oros, Copas, Espadas, Bastos).
   - Strategy: Use this when you don't have the matching color, or to switch the color to something you have more of.
